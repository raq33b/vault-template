Three point estimation moves away from ballpark estimating techniques and into establishing more accurate, realistic costs. This method involves taking an average of three scenarios: best case scenario, worst case scenario and most likely scenario.

Hereâ€™s a simple formula:

(Best + Worst + Most Likely Estimates) / 3 = Expected Estimate

-   For example, a lawyer believes a project will cost $1000 in the best case scenario and $1500 in the worst case scenario, with $1200 being the most likely figure.
    -   ($1000 + $1500 + $1200) / 3 = $1233.33 expected estimate

You can adjust the formula to weight different scenarios, as well.

-   For example, the lawyer actually believes that the project is more likely to end up with the worst case scenario. She wants to give more weight to the worst case scenario estimate in the formula.
    -   Assign weights and multiply by estimate: $1000(1) + $1500(2) + $1200(1) = 5200
    -   Add together your weights: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
    -   Divide first number by second: 5200 / 4 = $1300 expected estimate

**Advantages**: Delivers a more accurate estimate as it allows for unexpected problems in the project, which reduces your risk as a small company.

**Disadvantages**: Takes more time and is a more complicated technique to learn.
